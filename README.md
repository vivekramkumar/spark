## üõ† Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. **IMPORTANT**: Wait for the project to be fully set up (this can take 2-3 minutes)
3. Go to Settings > API in your Supabase dashboard
4. Copy your Project URL and anon/public key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add your Supabase credentials:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues:**
- Make sure the URL starts with `https://` and ends with `.supabase.co`
- The anon key should be a long string starting with `eyJ`
- Don't include quotes around the values
- Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` sign

### 3. Set Up Database

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the entire SQL content from `supabase/migrations/20250623181540_wispy_pebble.sql`
3. Paste it into the SQL editor and click **Run**
4. This creates the `profiles` table and security policies

### 4. Restart Development Server

After setting up the environment variables:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test the Connection

The app will automatically test the Supabase connection on startup. If there are issues, you'll see a detailed error screen with specific instructions.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "No project found" Error

This usually means one of the following:

1. **Project Still Setting Up**: Supabase projects take 2-3 minutes to fully initialize. Wait and try again.

2. **Wrong URL**: Make sure your URL is in the format: `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`

3. **Wrong Key**: Make sure you're using the `anon/public` key, not the `service_role` key.

4. **Environment Variables Not Loaded**: 
   - Restart your development server after creating the `.env` file
   - Make sure the `.env` file is in the project root (same level as `package.json`)

5. **Database Not Set Up**: Run the migration SQL in your Supabase dashboard.

- ‚úÖ **Green checkmarks**: Everything is configured correctly
- ‚ùå **Red X marks**: Issues that need to be fixed

### Environment Variables Not Working

1. Make sure your `.env` file is in the project root
