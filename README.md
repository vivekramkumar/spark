## üõ† Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Production Setup (Remote Supabase)

#### 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. **IMPORTANT**: Wait for the project to be fully set up (this can take 2-3 minutes)
3. Go to Settings > API in your Supabase dashboard
4. Copy your Project URL and anon/public key

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add your Supabase credentials:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues:**
- Make sure the URL starts with `https://` and ends with `.supabase.co`
- The anon key should be a long string starting with `eyJ`
- Don't include quotes around the values
- Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` sign

#### 3. Set Up Database

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the entire SQL content from `supabase/migrations/20250623181540_wispy_pebble.sql`
3. Paste it into the SQL editor and click **Run**
4. This creates the `profiles` table and security policies

### Option 2: Local Development Setup

For local development, we've provided scripts to help you set up a local Supabase instance:

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (required for local Supabase)
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS emulator)

#### Quick Setup

1. Run the initialization script:

```bash
./init-local-db.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a `.env` file with local Supabase credentials
- Initialize Supabase locally
- Start the local Supabase services
- Apply the database migrations

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. For iOS emulator:

```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

#### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually, follow the instructions in the `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` file.

#### Switching Between Local and Production

Use the provided script to easily switch between environments:

```bash
# Switch to local development
./switch-env.sh local

# Switch to production (requires setting PROD_SUPABASE_URL and PROD_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
./switch-env.sh prod
```

### 4. Restart Development Server

After setting up the environment variables:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test the Connection

The app will automatically test the Supabase connection on startup. If there are issues, you'll see a detailed error screen with specific instructions.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "No project found" Error

This usually means one of the following:

1. **Project Still Setting Up**: Supabase projects take 2-3 minutes to fully initialize. Wait and try again.

2. **Wrong URL**: Make sure your URL is in the format: `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`

3. **Wrong Key**: Make sure you're using the `anon/public` key, not the `service_role` key.

4. **Environment Variables Not Loaded**: 
   - Restart your development server after creating the `.env` file
   - Make sure the `.env` file is in the project root (same level as `package.json`)

5. **Database Not Set Up**: Run the migration SQL in your Supabase dashboard.

### Local Development Issues

1. **Docker Not Running**: Make sure Docker is running on your machine
2. **Supabase CLI Not Installed**: Install with `npm install -g supabase`
3. **Port Conflicts**: Make sure ports 54321-54326 are available
4. **Database Reset**: If schema issues occur, run `supabase db reset`

### Connection Test Failed

The app includes a built-in connection tester that will show you exactly what's wrong:

- ‚úÖ **Green checkmarks**: Everything is configured correctly
- ‚ùå **Red X marks**: Issues that need to be fixed
- **Detailed error messages**: Specific guidance for each type of error

### Environment Variables Not Working

1. Make sure your `.env` file is in the project root
2. Restart the development server completely
3. Check that variable names start with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`
4. Verify there are no typos in the variable names
